# UIKit P0/P1 verification

These packages are verification prototypes. They do not depend on, or create, the production UIKit packages. Run commands from the repository root on macOS with the two specified Unity editors installed.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s Tools/Verification -p 'test_*.py'
python3 Tools/Verification/run.py prepare --phase p0 --editor all --backend all
python3 Tools/Verification/run.py tests --editor all --backend all --mode PlayMode --suite init
python3 Tools/Verification/run.py prepare --phase p1 --editor all --backend all
python3 Tools/Verification/run.py tests --editor all --backend all --mode PlayMode --suite init
python3 Tools/Verification/run.py tests --editor all --backend all --mode PlayMode --suite input-preflight
python3 Tools/Verification/run.py gate --name preflight
```

The four hosts use separate Library/Temp directories. Never open a host with another Unity version. The runner checks the app bundle version before opening a host and checks the actual editor version in its log. Tests use batchmode with graphics, without `-quit`.

`input-preflight` maps to NUnit Category `input_preflight`: NUnit rejects hyphens in category names. Backend test assemblies reference the common PlayMode assembly for shared scenarios. `TestAssemblies` supplies TestRunner/NUnit references; explicit duplicate TestRunner references are omitted because Unity rejects them.

`UIKIT_RED_INIT=1` deliberately uses the active-parent control in the inactive-parent assertion. `UIKIT_RED_INPUT=1` makes the gate a pass-through control. Both are expected to fail their safety assertions; use only for regression-control runs. The unlocked input control must pass, proving that a quiet gate test is not caused by absent input.

The legacy backend injects a BaseInput override and exposes held state through ILegacyReleaseState, because BaseInput only exposes button-down edges. The default release provider polls public Unity Input APIs. The Input System backend uses an isolated InputTestFixture and synthetic Mouse/Keyboard/Gamepad/Touchscreen devices. All input runs through the actual module Process method. ExecuteEvents is used only for explicit cancellation notifications on framework-owned nodes, never to inject test input.

On revocation, the node snapshot sends pointerUp/endDrag without click/drop, selection is cleared, and the module resets via public DeactivateModule / enabled lifecycle. The legacy module's DeactivateModule clears protected pointer data. For Input System, disabling/re-enabling invokes its own pointer-reset lifecycle. Nodes snapshot callback data because Input System reuses PointerEventData between mouse buttons. Processing resumes only after the raw controls are neutral, followed by a fresh input edge.

Each run writes XML, logs, traces, host snapshots, a command record and a summary under ignored Artifacts/uikit. G0 requires current source/configuration fingerprints and all required cases on both suites in all four hosts. Changes during a run invalidate its result. Missing XML/cases, skipped/inconclusive/failed cases, compiler errors, timeout and nonzero process exit all fail closed.

Limits: these are Editor preflight tests, not mobile/IL2CPP release acceptance or production UIKit tests. Input System Submit/Cancel uses keyboard keys; navigation uses the gamepad stick. Physical gamepad Submit/Cancel buttons are not claimed as verified. T2 and later tasks require separate authorization.
